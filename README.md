## Project Description

An all in one travel website for traveling within Canada for the next month.

Where there are two categories:
- intra-province travel between the major cities in each province and
- inter-provinces travel amongst all the ten provinces in Canada!

What can be booked? Flights that meet all your requirements including on the departure city, the price, and more!

Users that are not signed in
- View all information
- but cannot make any bookings

Users that are signed in:
- View all information
- Make bookings
- Keep track of their shopping cart, addresses, and even their shopping history

One may wonder how they can signin. Users can sign in by:
- registering an account with our secure backend server or
- have the option of signing in using third-party authentication (Google, facebook)
